        <div class="about-p"> 
            I am a <b>current freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b>, with an intended 
            double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.<br>
            <br>
            A 2019 graduate from Poolesville High School's Science, Math, and Computer Science magnet program,
            I am interested in combining artificial intelligence to solve global healthcare issues. I am currently
            working on Health Analytics and Integrated Healthcare at IBM Research, and I have previously worked in
            AI for healthcare at both the Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento, Italy as well as at the George 
            Washington University in Washington, D.C.<br>
            <br>
            Outside of academics, I am interested in investigating the intersection of art, media, and technology 
            through mediums such as graphic design and fashion. At MIT, I am currently involved in Women Business 
            Leaders, StartLabs, Infinite Magazine, Machine Intelligence Community, and Mirchi. I have also learned 
            competitive classical piano and Bharatanatyam (Indian classical dance) for 14 years. <br>
