                <div class="description">
                    I co-designed and co-illustrated this risograph-printed zine about snails. There is no real concept
                    in this zine other than the existential dread of being a snail in a large capitalistic world. <br><br>

                    Thanks to <span style="color:darkgreen">Kevin Chen</span> for co-illustrating with me and for printing and compiling the zines.
                    We printed and distributed 80 copies of this zine. Nearly everything was done on Figma or illustrated by hand. This also features
                    some AI generated poetry. <br><br>
